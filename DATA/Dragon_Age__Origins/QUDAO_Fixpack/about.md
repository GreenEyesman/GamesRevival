Qwinn's Ultimate Dragon Age: Origins Fixpack
Author:  Paul Escalona (aka Qwinn)
Original Release Date:  April 15, 2010
Current Release Date:  November 30, 2017
Current Version#: 3.4

WHAT IT DOES, AND WHAT TO EXPECT:

This fixpack attempts to address ALL dialogue, quest, scripting, plot, and MOST item bugs in the base game of Dragon Age: Origins.  As of version 3.4 it fixes more than 790 such bugs.  It also attempts to restore any cut content that is consistent with all existing content, and that doesn't appear to have been cut for any reason other than time or budget constraints.

Note that my intent here is to fix the game, not tweak it to my liking. I only change something if I believe the game's behavior in any given instance was more than likely -not intended- by the developers.  In other words, I try to fix bugs.  Actual bugs.  As opposed to, "I forgot to talk to the guy in the Lothering Chantry for the Blackstone Irregulars and now I can't get back to him, that's a bug, fix it!".  No.  That was actually intended, as is clear if you read the completed failed entry for that quest.  Now, if I make a change to something that someone believes was intended, please do offer up arguments/evidence in support of that in the comments section where you downloaded this or any other forum I may come up with to support this Fixpack.  I enjoy hashing that sort of thing out.

I have no future plans to do fixpacks for Awakening, DLC, Dragon Age 2 or Inquisition unless Bioware would like to pay me a fair wage to do so and they unlock the encryption for me.

WHAT IT DOESN'T DO:

This fixpack makes no attempt to fix combat mechanics.  It also makes no changes to graphics, textures or morphs.  Any mods that make those sorts of fixes *should* be fully compatible.  It does not attempt to fix bugs in Awakening or any of the other DLC, with two exceptions:  one related to giving Oghren gifts in Awakening (OG3003), and a fix moving a camera in a specific stage used in dozens of dialogues throughout the game (and probably in the DLC as well) in order to prevent large armor shoulder pauldrons or large weapons from occluding the speaker's face, sometimes completely and for significant stretches of dialogue (see GL3209).

RESTORATION HIGHLIGHTS (this is above and beyond many many dozens of lines restored here and there in various dialogues):

COMPATIBILITY:

This mod is most likely not going to be compatible with most mods that modify dialogue, quests and some items.  The following mods are not compatible, but they are also mainly not necessary as all bugs and restorations they deal with are also dealt with in this fixpack.  This list is by no means complete, it's just what I'm aware of:

NOT COMPATIBLE AND MOSTLY OR COMPLETELY REDUNDANT

Alistair Dialog Patch (ADP) - Bugs are all dealt with, 4 tweaks listed in the readme were not implemented.
Zevran Dialogue Fixes (ZDF) - Only things in the readme not dealt with are some tweaks to kisses.
Leliana Fixes - All issues dealt with, though not always the same way
Morrigan Restoration Pack (MRP) - Only things in the readme not dealt with are Angry Kiss and Dark Ritual Kiss because they are tweaks.
Dialogue Tweaks - Bugs addressed, tweaks are not.
Tiny Fixes - Completely Redundant
A Lost Nug Quest Fix - Completely Redundant (though with different reward)
Unobtainable Item BUGFIX - I do not restore 2 two handed swords in Korcari Wilds as I believe they were cut deliberately
Jowan and Another Different Jowan - Completely Redundant
Ancient Elven Boots Fix - Completely Redundant
Fang at Tier 7 - Completely Redundant
Golem Registry and Shapers Life Reward Fix - Completely Redundant
Shale Will Come For Me Restoration Fix - Completely Redundant
Templar Armor Fixes - Completely Redundant
The Gnawed Notebook - Completely Redundant
Her Hammer is her... uh.. never mind - Completely Redundant
Fixed political support in "A Paragon of her Kind" - Completely Redundant, though my implementation is slightly different
Cammen's Lament Quest Fix - Fixed much much more thoroughly in this Fixpack
Human Female Cocky Voice - Completely Redundant
Chevalier Armor Set Bonus Change - Completely redundant
Zevring - Fixes are redundant, but I do not make the ring a usable item
Bye Oghren - Redundant, but with a difference - if you turn down Oghren's request to join you, you don't get another chance to recruit him.
Jowan's Intention Fix (at Bioware site) - Completely Redundant
Give Robbed Elves Money Patch - Completely Redundant

PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE:

Improved Atmosphere - portions of this could probably be added successfully, with some major surgery.  Installing both mods in their entirety is known to cause issues with Crime Wave and Trial of Crows quests, and probably many additional issues not yet discovered.  Much of IA is redundant, though, as the fixes listed in the Readme are dealt with in this fixpack, but tweaks are not.  The following folders would PROBABLY be okay to add (not actually tested):  1.  Global (Animations, Materials and Tints only), 5. Awakening Expansion, 6. Downloadable Content, 7.2 Awakening Quick Items, 7.3 Optional Campaign Mods (Alistair Climax Speech and Release Jowan ONLY), 7.5 Weapons VFX Remover, and finally the single file party_barks.dlg (which makes all followers give their location based barks, instead of just one) that can be found in "4. Companions / 4.1 Dialog Changes / Global Dialog Changes".   Thanks to firepanda of the Nexus forums for helping me put that list together.

NOT COMPATIBLE (Confirmed):

Equal Love (If you want that sort of thing, use GoesOnGhost's Complete Bi Overhaul instead as it is compatible).

Any mod that modifies companion dialogues.  You will at least lose my own fixes that changed those files if you install such mods, and there's nothing I can do about that without the other modder's cooperation.  I have changed my previous stance and am now willing to attempt to address more significant compatibility issues with mods that alter the follower dialogues, UNLESS they are already listed in the "Mostly or Completely Redundant" list above.  Just let me know about the compatibility issues on the posts page.

REGARDING PLAYER_CORE.NSS:  Many combat rule type fixpacks and other mods make changes to this file.  The ONLY change I make to it is related to fix GL3002, the fix that corrects some soundset bugs (the lines played when you click on your followers).  If you install other mods that alter player_core.nss/ncs, you will lose GL3002, so Alistair may start calling your male warden "My Love" at 100 approval again, and your followers will be strangely hostile when you click on them at neutral approval levels, but aside from losing that fix, the other mods should work without issue. 

CONFIRMED COMPATIBLE:

* The lists in parentheses are the mods in that category that were reported as fully compatible during and after v3.0 and v3.1 BETA testing.

Any morph, texture or visual/graphics mods (* Bidelles Cosmetics, CC Extra Tints & Tones, Leliana Facemorph, Leliana Sacred Ashes Armor (normal and update v1.1), LOTC's Longer Eyelashes, More_Hairstyles, Morrigan Tweaked, NBaio, Practical Dalish Female Armor, PT's Vibrant Colours, Tucked Hair, UDF Dyekit, Robes of Possession - Retex of Jewelry, Personal Annoyance Remover and pretty much any other mod in this category) 

Any mods that strictly address combat mechanics (* Full Combatant Dog)

Any Awakening-only mods (* several were confirmed but not bothering to list as they should all work)

Any mods for other DA:O DLC

Some gameplay mods (* Extra Dog Slot, Alley of Murders, Skip The Fade, ZevranASAP, The Rescue At Ishal, Cousland Sword and Shield, Level 50, FtG UI Mod, FtG Quickbar, AddItem with Console Improved - Script, Damage Statistic Fix, No Helmet Hack) 

Most mods that only directly alter existing cutscenes should work. (* Better Sex Cutscenes)

GoesOnGhost's "Complete Bi Overhaul" mod.

RECOMMENDED MODS:

Either "Elfy Ghost Boy" by theskymoves, or "Ghost Elves" by mintflavoredwindows, both available on the Nexus forums.  I don't handle these because this is the only bug I'm aware of that requires a morph fix, and I don't want to make a lie of my claim that my mod won't conflict with ANY morph mods.  That the boy in the Brecilian Ruins needs to be changed to an elf is indisputably a fix - multiple references to him as an elf can be seen in the toolset.  The evidence is less absolute for the mother, but she also speaks elven, and my guess is that the mother was probably also intended to be an elf.  If you want to change just the boy, use "Elfy Ghost Boy", and if you think the mother should also be an elf, use "Ghost Elves".

RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:

It came to light in the final days of creating version 3.0 that having Vertical Sync disabled can have some strange effects - specifically, it causes Gorim to not reach your prison cell in the Dwarf Noble origin.  I fixed that single issue, but as I did all my development and testing with VSync enabled, I did not catch any other instances where that issue could have an effect.  I therefore recommend having VSync enabled if possible.
It's not necessary, but I also did all my development with 3D Vision and it worked quite well, aside from some cutscenes looking a little glassy.  If you have the hardware for it, I certainly recommend it for Dragon Age: Origins.

LANGUAGE SUPPORT:

As of version 3.4, there is no multi-language support for this Fixpack. If installing it on a foreign language version, it will replace a small amount of text with english text.  My apologies to the international players. :(

HOW TO INSTALL:

Use daupdater.exe (found in your Dragon Age installation's bin_ship directory) to install the accompanying .DAZIP file as an addon (viewable and toggle-able from the Downloadable Content menu option).  Please be sure to *actually extract* the .dazip from the .zip the mod comes in before trying to drop it into daupdater.exe.

ORGANIZATION:

I have organized the readme hoping to avoid spoilers as much as possible.  You therefore won't find much in the way of references to later game events under the companion sections, for example (this is why the ALISTAIR section is so short - he has *tons* of fixes but most of them are listed under the Landsmeet, Dark Ritual, etc. sections for reasons obvious to those already spoiled.)  Within each section, I've tried to order the fixes in the order you're likely to come across them within that area, and group fixes pertaining to a specific quest all together, for those trying to use a walkthrough and consult this readme at the same time.  I do tend to list side quests prior to main quests.

The code system used to reference fixes, established in v3.0 BETA, has been changed as of v3.2 from a 5 character code to 6 characters.  The first two alpha characters still denote the category they are listed under in the readme (see the following category list).  The next two digits are now the version number where the fix was added to my fixpacks (and it is for this reason that v3.01 BETA is being retconned to be remembered as v3.1 BETA).  The last two digits are used to establish the order in the readme.  With this new system, I can insert new fixes without having to reorder or renumber existing fixes, and therefore the code used to denote any particular fix should not change from v3.2 on.

If you are looking for a specific fix, and it could potentially belong to multiple categories below, you are most likely to find it by finding the *last* category in the following list that matches what you're looking for.  For example, you won't find any PLOT ITEM REMOVAL fixes anywhere above that section.  If you're looking for a fix to something about Morrigan during the Dark Ritual conversation, you'll find it in the Dark Ritual section, not under Morrigan.  If an event is tied to a specific location and can't happen anywhere else, you're most likely to find it in the section for that location (so all restored party bark/comments are listed in the respective location where they can now be heard).  Note that there is no PARTY CAMP section - things that can only happen in the party camp will generally be under the relevant companion's section.
